# bridging

### There are two folders here, each of which includes instructions and codes for one pipeline. Both pipelines are written in Python3

## 1. from_pacbio_to_tbc-cbc-bridge

### This pipeline reads raw fastq sequencing data generated by PacBio, then generates a list of 10x cellular barcode (CBC) and Lu Lab Clonal Tracking Barcode (TBC) corresponding pairs;
### It is provided as individual python codes that need to be sequentially run.

## 2. from_bridge_to_associated-genes

### This pipeline reads processed single cell gene expression data (transcriptomic profiles of individual HSCs) and processed clonal tracking data (quantitative stem cell activities of individual HSC clones), calculates false positive score, and identifies genes whose expressions are significantly associated with a distinct stem cell activity;
### It is provided as Jupyter Notebook, with codes and explanations.
